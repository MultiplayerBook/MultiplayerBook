 :: INTRODUCTION ::

  Greetings, welcome to the readme file for my fonts. That's it. :)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

 :: TERMS OF USE ::

  Currently all my fonts are freeware. That doesn't mean however, that you can
 do whatever you want with them. Here are the rules for use and distribution:

  1. You WILL NOT modify the fonts, the copyright notices, or this text file.
  2. You WILL NOT sell the fonts in ANY way.
  3. Whatever you do with it, you take full responsibility.
 
  Those are the rules you MUST follow to use or distribute these fonts. If you
 disagree, stop using the fonts immediately. If I grow aware of any violations
 of these terms, expect legal action to be taken. So, you have been warned.

  And, if you decide to use any of the fonts for commercial purposes, it would
 be really nice to receive a product sample. I can make a special version of a
 font exclusively for you as well. Just e-mail me if you are interested.
